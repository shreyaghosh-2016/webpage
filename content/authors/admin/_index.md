Shreya Ghosh (শ্রেয়া ঘোষ) is a postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania State University,
USA since Dec 2021. Her research interests are in the areas of misinformation
detection on social media using linguistic cues and network structure, and spatio-
temporal data analytics (night-time light data and trajectory transfer learning).
Additionally, she is passionate about applying artificial intelligence to analyze and
understand wildlife mobility and human-wildlife conflict. Shreya completed her
PhD from IIT Kharagpur in 2021 on semantic analysis of human movement and
understanding human movement behaviours. More generally, she is interested in
applied data science and application-oriented research projects with a focus on NLP
and spatial informatics. Her scholarly work has been published in top-tier
conferences and journals such as WWW, ICWSM, ECML PKDD, IEEE Transactions
on Services Computing etc.
