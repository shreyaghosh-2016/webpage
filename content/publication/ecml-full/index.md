abstract: As social networks become the primary sources of information, the rise of misinformation poses a significant threat to the information ecosystem. 
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The growth of social media underscores the need for early misinformation detection, as traditional methods often lag due to a lack of initial dissemination data. This paper introduces a model that classifies misinformation based on propagation paths and linguistic cues, and uses a causal user attribute inference to pinpoint potential misinformation spreaders or believers. The proposed model can accurately detect fake news within 30 minutes of its first appearance, achieving 86.5% accuracy before 50 retweets, surpassing current benchmarks.
