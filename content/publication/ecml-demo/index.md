abstract: As social networks become the primary sources of information, the rise of misinformation poses a significant threat to the information ecosystem. 
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Social networks' role as primary information sources has led to a rise in misinformation, threatening the information ecosystem. This study introduces a system that assigns misinformation scores to tweets in real-time using a mix of Temporal Graph Network (TGN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track how misinformation spreads. This approach uses active learning, a dual model system, a temporal embargo based on belief scores, and a retraining method, showing significant accuracy in identifying and reducing misinformation propagation across five datasets.
